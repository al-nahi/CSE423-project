# Stickman Obstacle Jumping Game

Rule - 
1. Have to jump using space.
2. We are jumping to avoid the thorns and half circles.
3. If collison occurs, then game over.
4. The 3 boxs present in the game are level buttons where Yellow means easy, Green means medium and Red means hard. Can select them using mouse click.
5. Has pause, restart and cancel buttons.

That's all.

Special note - use the file after extracting the opengl zip file and in the same folder where the opengl file is extracted.
